# Employee Performance Classification

## Project Overview ##

Employee performance classification is a machine learning and deep learning-based project aimed at categorizing employees based on their performance. The system processes textual performance reviews and classifies employees into categories such as "Needs Improvement," "Average," "Good," and "Excellent." This classification helps organizations assess and enhance employee productivity effectively.

## Project Title ##

Employee Performance Classification using Natural Language Processing

## Project Abstract ##

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques along with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to classify employee performance based on textual feedback. The dataset consists of performance review statements, which undergo preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, BERT, and RoBERTa. The goal is to develop a robust and efficient model for performance assessment, aiding HR teams in decision-making processes.

## Algorithms Used ##

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

Machine Learning Models:

* Random Forest Classifier

* Gradient Boosting Classifier

* Ensemble Model (Voting Classifier with RF & GB)

Deep Learning Models:

* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Language Models:

* BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

* RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)

## Key Observations & Challenges ##

Observations:

* Deep learning models (BERT & RoBERTa) outperformed traditional ML models in classification accuracy.

* Feature engineering and data preprocessing significantly impacted model performance.

* SMOTE improved class balance but required careful tuning to avoid overfitting.

Challenges:

* Imbalanced dataset led to biased model predictions.

* Computationally expensive deep learning models required high processing power.

* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction were crucial for optimizing performance.

## Potential Improvements & Future Work ##

* Integration of additional NLP techniques: Experimenting with advanced transformer models such as GPT-based architectures.

* Hyperparameter tuning: Further fine-tuning of deep learning models to enhance accuracy.

* Expanding the dataset: Incorporating a more diverse dataset for generalization.

* Deployment: Implementing a web-based application for real-time classification and feedback analysis.

## Conclusion ##

The Employee Performance Classification project successfully demonstrates how NLP and ML/DL techniques can be leveraged to assess employee performance. The results indicate that deep learning models provide superior classification accuracy, although traditional ML models also perform well with optimized feature engineering. Future enhancements can further improve the modelâ€™s effectiveness, making it a valuable tool for HR management and decision-making processes.
