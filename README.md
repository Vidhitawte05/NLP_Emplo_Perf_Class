# Employee Performance Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying employee performance using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It employs various feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, FastText), ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes, SVM), and Deep Learning models to analyze textual performance reviews and categorize them into different performance levels.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF, FastText).
- **Data Balancing**: Uses SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Naïve Bayes
  - SVM
- **Deep Learning**:
  - Neural networks for text classification
  - Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple models for better accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
